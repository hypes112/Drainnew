class="vis-page"><div class="vis-main"><div class="vis-section"><div class="vis-content"><h1 class="vision-h1">GATEWAY TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h1><p class="vis-paragraph">Welcome to the Gateway, a website-hosted user interface (the &quot;Interface&quot;) provided by the Optimism Foundation (the &quot;Foundation&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, or &quot;us&quot;).<br><br>Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of the Interface. These Terms and Conditions (the “Interface Terms”) are a binding contract between you and us. Your use of the Interface in any way means that you have read and agree to all of the Interface Terms, the <a href="data-privacy-policy.html" class="link-17">Data Privacy Policy</a>, and the <a href="community-notice.html" class="link-18">Community Notice</a> which are incorporated herein by reference. In addition, certain features and product offerings may be subject to additional guidelines, terms, or rules, which will be posted in connection with such features and product offerings. All such additional terms, guidelines, and rules are incorporated by reference into the Interface Terms. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding the Interface Terms or the Interface, please contact us at <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="402c2527212c002f3034292d29332d6e292f6e">[email&#160;protected]</a><strong>‍<br><br>Please read the Interface</strong> <strong>Terms carefully.</strong>  They cover important information about the Interface, as well as information about future changes to the Interface Terms, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability. They require that <strong>you assume all of the risks associated with using the Interface</strong>. IN ADDITION, SECTION 16 CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WHICH WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, REQUIRE DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US TO BE SUBMITTED TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION. <strong>UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT (a) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE CLAIMS AND SEEK RELIEF AGAINST US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING, AND (b) YOU ARE AGREEING TO MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION FOR THE RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES AND WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL ON YOUR CLAIMS.</strong><br><br>PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR USE OF THE INTERFACE IS SUBJECT TO THE INTERFACE TERMS<strong>.</strong> IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE INTERFACE TERMS IN THEIR ENTIRETY, YOU MAY NOT USE THE INTERFACE IN ANY MANNER.<br><br><strong>1. Changes to terms<br>‍<br></strong>We reserve the right to change the Interface Terms at any time. If we do so, we’ll let you know by updating the date at the bottom of the Interface Terms and by maintaining a current version of the Interface Terms at https://www.optimism.io/gateway-terms.<br><br>If you don’t agree with the new Interface Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you must stop accessing or using the Interface. If you access or use the Interface in any way after a change to the Interface Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.<br><br>Except for changes by us as described in this section, no other amendment or modification of the Interface Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.<br><br><strong>2. Basics of using the Interface<br>‍<br>‍</strong>You represent and warrant that you are an individual of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you have received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Interface and have gotten your parent or guardian to agree to the Interface Terms on your behalf). If you are agreeing to the Interface Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to the Interface Terms on that organization’s or entity’s behalf and bind them to the Interface Terms (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in the Interface Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity).<br><br>You will comply with all laws that apply to you, your use of the Interface, and your actions and omissions that relate to the Interface. If your use of the Interface is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Interface. We can’t and won’t be responsible for your using the Interface in a way that breaks the law.<br><br>Without limiting the foregoing, you represent and warrant that you are not, and for the duration of the time you use the Interface will not be (a) the subject of economic or trade sanctions administered or enforced by any governmental authority or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted parties (including but not limited to the United Nations Security Council, the European Union, His Majesty’s Treasury, and U.S. Department of Treasury), or (b) a citizen, resident, or organized in a jurisdiction or territory that is the subject of comprehensive country-wide, territory-wide, or regional economic sanctions by the United Nations, European Union, any EU country, UK Treasury, or the United States, including without limitation Cuba, the Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Syria, or Yemen. If at any point the above is no longer true, you must immediately cease using the Interface.<br><br>‍<strong>3. Interface vs. Protocol<br>‍<br>‍</strong>The Interface facilitates your ability to access Optimism, a decentralized, peer-to-peer Layer 2 rollup protocol on the Ethereum public blockchain (the “Protocol”). The Interface is distinct from the Protocol. It provides one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol. The Foundation does not own or control the Protocol, which is public, permissionless, and runs on open-source self-executing smart contracts.<br><br>The Protocol enables people to do various things, such as processing Ethereum transactions more efficiently, viewing, deriving, and verifying information on the Ethereum and Optimism public blockchains, passing messages, information, and tokens (including digital assets) between the Ethereum and Optimism public blockchains (“bridging”), and interacting with smart contract-based applications (“dApps”).<br><br>The Interface, on the other hand, enables you to initiate messages to the Protocol to bridge digital assets between the Ethereum and Optimism public blockchains, and between Optimism and other public blockchains. Depending on how you use the Interface (a) these messages may be sent directly to the Protocol or routed through various third-party interfaces and dApps, and (b) the bridging smart contracts you interact with may be inherent to the Protocol itself or independently developed and deployed by various third parties (“non-standard bridges”).<br><br>The Interface is experimental in nature. It represents an example reference implementation only. It is not intended to be used as a primary means of accessing or interacting with the Protocol.<br><br>‍<strong>4. Accessing the Interface<br>‍<br></strong>To access the Interface you must use non-custodial wallet software (a “Web3 wallet”), which constructs and broadcasts the data (“transactions”) that allows you to interact with the Protocol. By using your Web3 wallet in connection with accessing the Interface, you agree that you are using the Web3 wallet under the terms and conditions of the applicable provider of the Web3 wallet. No Web3 wallet is created by, operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with us. Accordingly, we do not have custody or control over the contents of your Web3 wallet and we have no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. Your relationship with any given Web3 wallet provider is governed by the applicable terms of service of that third party, not the Interface Terms.<br><br>‍<strong>5. Digital asset ownership and control<br>‍<br></strong>You own and control the digital assets held in and bridged via your Web3 wallet. You bear all risk of loss of and relating to such digital assets, including but not limited to fluctuations in value.<br><br>‍<strong>6. Third-party products and information<br>‍<br></strong>The Interface contains references, links, and enables you to connect to third-party resources including (but not limited to) Web3 wallets, non-standard bridges, dApps, and other information, materials, products, or services, which we do not own or control (collectively, “third-party products”). We do not approve, monitor, endorse, make any representations or warranties (expressly or implicitly) or assume any responsibility for any third-party products, any component thereof, or the manner in which those products or components interact with the Interface. When you use or rely on any third-party products, you do so at your own risk. You understand that you are solely responsible for any fees or costs associated with using third-party products and that, unless stated herein, the Interface Terms do not otherwise apply to your dealings or relationships with any third parties or third-party products.<br><br>‍<strong>7. License to use the Interface<br>‍<br>‍</strong>Subject to your compliance with the Interface Terms, you are granted a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, personal license to use and access the Interface.<br><br>‍<strong>8. Assumption of risk<br>‍<br>‍</strong>By using the Interface, you (a) represent that you are sophisticated enough to understand the various inherent risks of using cryptographic and public blockchain-based systems, including but not limited to the Interface, the Protocol, and digital assets such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and other digital tokens such as those following the ERC-20 Ethereum token standard, and (b) acknowledge and accept all such risks, and agree that we make no representations or warranties (expressly or implicitly) regarding, and that you will not hold us liable for those risks, including but not limited to the risks described below, any or all of which could lead to losses and damages, including the total and irrevocable loss of your assets.</p><ul role="list" class="list-3"><li><strong>Wallet security and safekeeping. </strong>You are solely responsible for the safeguarding and security of your Web3 wallets. If you lose your wallet seed phrase, private keys, or password, you may be forever unable to access your digital assets. Any unauthorized access to your wallet by third parties could result in the loss or theft of your digital assets. We have no involvement in, or responsibility for, storing, retaining, securing or recovering your Web3 wallet seed phrases, private keys, or passwords, or for any unauthorized access to your Web3 wallet.</li><li><strong>Blockchain technology.  </strong>Public blockchains, and the technology underlying and interacting with cryptographic and public blockchain-based systems, are experimental, inherently risky, and subject to change. Among other risks, bugs, malfunctions, cyberattacks, or changes to a particular public blockchain (e.g., via forks) could disrupt these technologies irreparably. There is no guarantee that any of these technologies will not become unavailable, degraded, or subject to hardware or software errors, operational or technical difficulties, denial-of-service attacks, other cyberattacks, or other problems requiring maintenance, interruptions, delays, or errors.</li><li><strong>Network cost and performance.</strong>  The cost, speed, and availability of transacting on public blockchain systems are subject to significant variability. There is no guarantee that any transfer will be confirmed or transferred successfully.</li><li><strong>Blockchain transactions and smart contract execution.</strong>  Public blockchain-based transactions (including but not limited to transactions automatically executed by smart contracts) are generally considered irreversible when confirmed. Any transaction that will interact with smart contracts or be recorded on a public blockchain must be recorded with extreme caution.</li><li><strong>Digital assets. </strong> The markets for digital assets are nascent and highly volatile due to various risk factors including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. Digital assets and their underlying blockchain networks are complex emerging technologies that may be subject to delays, halts or go offline as a result of errors, forks, attacks or other unforeseeable reasons. Anyone can create a digital asset, including fake versions of existing digital assets and digital assets that falsely claim to represent projects. So-called stablecoins may not be as stable as they purport to be, may not be fully or adequately collateralized, and may be subject to panics and runs. You are solely responsible for understanding the risks specific to each digital asset that is relevant to you.</li><li><strong>Bridging.  </strong>In addition to being an especially novel and untested implementation of blockchain technology in general, cross-blockchain bridging technology has historically been, and may in the future be, the subject of numerous cyberattacks and exploits, including without limitation, hacks that exploit a vulnerability in the associated software, hardware, systems or other equipment or social engineering to gain control of the any bridge components, wallets, smart contracts or other related systems. </li><li><strong>Control of the Protocol.  </strong>The Protocol is subject to periodic upgrades based on votes by a decentralized, representative body of Optimism governance (the “Optimism Collective”). Although the Foundation stewards and administers certain governance processes of the Collective, it does not control the outcomes of governance votes. The Collective may vote to implement, or fail to implement, a protocol upgrade that significantly impacts the the Protocol, or introduces other risks, bugs, malfunctions, cyberattack vectors, or other changes to the Protocol that could disrupt the operation of the Interface, the functionality of Optimism bridging, your ability to access bridged digital assets, or otherwise cause you damage or loss.</li><li><strong>Third Party Risks.  </strong>Third-party products carry their own individual, oftentimes highly significant risks. When you use the Interface to interact with any third-party products, you are subject to all of those risks.</li><li><strong>Tax and compliance.  </strong>Digital assets may be subject to taxation. It is your sole responsibility to determine whether, and to what extent, any taxes apply to any transactions you conduct in connection with your use of the Interface, and to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities.</li><li><strong>Legislative and regulatory risks.  </strong>Digital assets, blockchain technology, and any related software and services are subject to legal and regulatory uncertainty in the United States and other jurisdictions. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions may adversely affect the usage, transferability, transactability and accessibility of digital assets, bridging, the Protocol, or the Interface.</li></ul><ul role="list" class="list-2 w-list-unstyled"></ul><p class="paragraph-2">In summary, by using the Interface, you represent that you understand, and agree to accept full responsibility for all of the risks.

Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. You agree that any judicial proceeding will be brought in the courts located in the Cayman Islands.<br><br><strong>16. </strong><strong>Dispute Resolution; Arbitration.  </strong>‍<br><br>‍<strong>Please read carefully the following arbitration agreement (this “Arbitration Agreement”). It requires you to arbitrate disputes with the Foundation and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us. </strong><br></p><ul role="list" class="list-3"><li class="list-item-4"><strong>Applicability of this Arbitration Agreement.</strong>  You agree that any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to the Interface Terms or to any aspect of your relationship with the Foundation, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (i) you may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if your claims qualify, and (ii) you or the Foundation may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and requests for relief that arose or were asserted before the effective date of the Interface Terms or any prior version of the Interface Terms.<strong> </strong> </li><li class="list-item-4"><strong>Arbitration rules and forum.  </strong>The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your dispute or claim or request for relief to <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="79151c1e18153916090d1014100a1457101657">[email&#160;protected]</a> The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims, counterclaims, or request for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other disputes shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, the arbitrator may require the Foundation to pay the additional cost. You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitration rules and applicable law provide otherwise. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, the Foundation will pay the remaining filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim does not exceed $75,000. For claims above $75,000, fees and costs will be determined in accordance with applicable JAMS rules. The arbitration rules permit you to recover attorney’s fees in certain cases. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any arbitration demand or counterclaim asserted by either party must contain sufficient information to provide fair notice to the other party of the asserting party’s identity, the claims being asserted, and the factual allegations on which they are based. The arbitrator or JAMS may require amendment of any demand or counterclaim that does not satisfy these requirements. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with JAMS Rule 24 for any claims the arbitrator determines to be frivolous or improper (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11). The parties agree that JAMS has discretion to modify the amount or timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under JAMS’s Rules where it deems appropriate, provided that such modification does not increase the costs to you, and you waive any objection to such fee modification. The parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either party to the fees imposed by JAMS does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Arbitration Agreement while such challenge remains pending before JAMS, the arbitrator, or a court of competent jurisdiction.</li><li class="list-item-4"><strong>Authority of arbitrator.  </strong>The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (i) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, and (ii) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment of JAMS administrative or arbitrator fees (including the timing of such payments and remedies for nonpayment). The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and us. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, provided that the arbitrator shall also be empowered to consolidate claims raised between the same parties to a single arbitration proceeding. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.  No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration.</li><li class="list-item-4"><strong>Waiver of jury trial. </strong> YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and we are instead electing that all disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 16a (Applicability of this Arbitration Agreement) above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Arbitration Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</li><li class="list-item-4"><strong>Waiver of class or other non-individualized relief.  </strong>ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this section’s limitations as to a given dispute, claim, or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the courts of the Cayman Island. All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.</li><li class="list-item-4"><strong>30-day right to opt out.  </strong>You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="563a3331373a163926223f3b3f253b783f39">[email&#160;protected]</a> within 30 days after you first access the Interface. Your notice must include your name and address, the Web3 Wallet address used to connect to the Interface (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, (i) all other parts of this Arbitration Agreement will continue to apply to you, and (ii) the Foundation will not be bound by this Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</li><li class="list-item-4"><strong>Severability.  </strong>Except as provided in Section 16e (Waiver of class or other non-individualized relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such specific part or parts shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</li><li class="list-item-4"><strong>Survival of Agreement. </strong> This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.</li><li class="list-item-4"><strong>Modification.  </strong>Notwithstanding any provision in the Interface Terms to the contrary, we agree that if we make any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within 30 days of such change becoming effective by writing us at <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="8ee2ebe9efe2cee1fefae7e3e7fde3a0e7e1">[email&#160;protected]</a> and expressly opting out of this Arbitration Agreement.</li></ul><p class="paragraph-2"><strong>17.
