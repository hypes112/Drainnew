Dispute Resolution; Arbitration.  </strong>‍<br><br><strong>Please read carefully the following arbitration agreement (this “Arbitration Agreement”). It requires you to arbitrate disputes with the Foundation and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.</strong><br></p><p class="paragraph-2"><strong>a. </strong><strong>Applicability of this Arbitration Agreement.</strong>  You agree that any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to the Website Terms or to any aspect of your relationship with the Foundation, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (i) you may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if your claims qualify, and (ii) you or the Foundation may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and requests for relief that arose or were asserted before the effective date of the Website Terms or any prior version of the Website Terms.<strong> </strong> <br><br><strong>b. </strong><strong>Arbitration rules and forum.</strong>  The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your dispute or claim or request for relief to <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4c20292b2d200c233c382521253f2162252362">[email&#160;protected]</a> The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims, counterclaims, or request for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other disputes shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, the arbitrator may require the Foundation to pay the additional cost. You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitration rules and applicable law provide otherwise. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, the Foundation will pay the remaining filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim does not exceed $75,000. For claims above $75,000, fees and costs will be determined in accordance with applicable JAMS rules. The arbitration rules permit you to recover attorney’s fees in certain cases. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any arbitration demand or counterclaim asserted by either party must contain sufficient information to provide fair notice to the other party of the asserting party’s identity, the claims being asserted, and the factual allegations on which they are based. The arbitrator or JAMS may require amendment of any demand or counterclaim that does not satisfy these requirements. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with JAMS Rule 24 for any claims the arbitrator determines to be frivolous or improper (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11). The parties agree that JAMS has discretion to modify the amount or timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under JAMS’s Rules where it deems appropriate, provided that such modification does not increase the costs to you, and you waive any objection to such fee modification. The parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either party to the fees imposed by JAMS does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Arbitration Agreement while such challenge remains pending before JAMS, the arbitrator, or a court of competent jurisdiction.<br><br><strong>c.</strong> <strong>Authority of arbitrator.</strong>  The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (i) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, and (ii) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable,<strong> </strong>whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment of JAMS administrative or arbitrator fees (including the timing of such payments and remedies for nonpayment). The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and us. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, provided that the arbitrator shall also be empowered to consolidate claims raised between the same parties to a single arbitration proceeding. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.<strong>  </strong>No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration.<br><br><strong>d. </strong><strong>Waiver of jury trial. </strong> YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and we are instead electing that all disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 13a (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement) above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Arbitration Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.<strong><br><br>e.</strong> <strong>Waiver of class or other non-individualized relief.</strong>  ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this section’s limitations as to a given dispute, claim, or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the courts of the Cayman Island. All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.<strong><br><br>f. </strong><strong>30-day right to opt out. </strong> You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1f737a787e735f706f6b7672766c72317670">[email&#160;protected]</a> within 30 days after you first access the Service. Your notice must include your name and address, the Web3 address used to connect to the Site (if applicable), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, (i) all other parts of this Arbitration Agreement will continue to apply to you, and (ii) the Foundation will not be bound by this Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.<strong><br><br>g. </strong><strong>Severability.</strong>  Except as provided in Section 16.e (Waiver of class or other non-individualized relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such specific part or parts shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.<strong><br><br>h. </strong><strong>Survival of Agreement. </strong> This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.<strong><br><br>i. </strong><strong>Modification.</strong>  Notwithstanding any provision in the Website Terms to the contrary, we agree that if we make any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within 30 days of such change becoming effective by writing us at <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e08c8587818ca08f9094898d89938dce898f">[email&#160;protected]</a> and expressly opting out of this Arbitration Agreement.<br></p><p class="paragraph-3"><strong>14. Governing law <br><br>‍</strong>These Website Terms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of the Cayman Islands, excluding its body of law controlling conflict of laws. You agree that the Website shall be deemed to be based solely in the Cayman Islands, and that although the Website may be available in other jurisdictions, its availability does not give rise to general or specific personal jurisdiction in any forum outside the Cayman Islands. Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. You agree that any judicial proceeding will be brought in the courts located in the Cayman Islands.<strong><br><br>15. Conflict of Provisions<br><br></strong>In the event that there exists a conflict between any term, condition or provision contained within these Website Terms, and in any term, condition, or provision contained within any other specific part or feature, the term, condition, or provision contained in such specific part or feature will control.<br><strong><br>16. Severability<br></strong><br>Without limiting Section 13g (Severability), if any part or parts of the Website Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such part or parts shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Website Terms will continue in full force and effect.  <br>‍</p><p class="vis-signature">Date last updated: March 2, 2023</p></div></div></div></div><div class="footer-2022"><div class="page-padding"><div class="footer-content"><div class="footer-links-flex"><div class="footer-accordion-item"><div data-w-id="8edfbcd1-69dd-658a-7784-9f7314c6325d" class="footer-accordion-trigger"><div class="footer-links-title">Optimism</div><div class="footer-accordion-icon"></div></div><div class="footer-accordion-content"><a href="index-2.html" class="footer-link-2022">Home</a><a href="https://app.optimism.io/governance" target="_blank" class="footer-link-2022">Governance</a><a href="https://app.optimism.io/bridge" target="_blank" class="footer-link-2022">Bridge</a><a href="apps/all.html" class="footer-link-2022">Ecosystem</a><a href="https://help.optimism.io/" target="_blank" class="footer-link-2022">Help center</a><a href="https://optimism.canny.io/feature-requests" target="_blank" class="footer-link-2022">Feature request</a><div class="accordion-vertical-spacer"></div></div><div class="footer-line-mobile"></div></div><div class="footer-accordion-item"><div data-w-id="8edfbcd1-69dd-658a-7784-9f7314c6326d" class="footer-accordion-trigger"><div class="footer-links-title">Developers</div><div class="footer-accordion-icon"></div></div><div class="footer-accordion-content"><a href="https://community.optimism.io/" target="_blank" class="footer-link-2022">Documentation</a><a href="https://explorer.optimism.io/" target="_blank" class="footer-link-2022">Block explorer</a><a href="https://status.optimism.io/" target="_blank" class="footer-link-2022">Status</a><a href="https://immunefi.com/bounty/optimism/" target="_blank" class="footer-link-2022">Bug bounty</a><a href="https://dev.optimism.io/" target="_blank" class="footer-link-2022">Dev blog</a><a href="https://leimqo8fo47.typeform.com/optimism-mktg" target="_blank" class="footer-link-2022">Marketing support</a><a href="https://forms.monday.com/forms/c867f3f357707ff1fb4af0d3d5080710?r=use1" target="_blank" class="footer-link-2022">Get in touch</a><a href="https://github.com/ethereum-optimism" target="_blank" class="footer-link-2022">GitHub</a><div class="accordion-vertical-spacer"></div></div><div class="footer-line-mobile"></div></div><div class="footer-accordion-item"><div data-w-id="8edfbcd1-69dd-658a-7784-9f7314c63281" class="footer-accordion-trigger"><div class="footer-links-title">Community</div><div class="footer-accordion-icon"></div></div><div class="footer-accordion-content"><a href="https://discord-gateway.optimism.io/" target="_blank" class="footer-link-2022">Discord</a><a href="https://twitter.com/optimismFND" target="_blank" class="footer-link-2022">Twitter</a><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/optimismfnd" target="_blank" class="footer-link-2022">Twitch</a><a href="https://optimism.mirror.xyz/" target="_blank" class="footer-link-2022">Blog</a><a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_4hui70itm089e7t8q50heh1kno@group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/Denver" target="_blank" class="footer-link-2022">Events</a><a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_4hui70itm089e7t8q50heh1kno@group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/Denver" target="_blank" class="footer-link-2022">Newsletter</a><div class="accordion-vertical-spacer"></div></div><div class="footer-line-mobile"></div></div><div class="footer-accordion-item"><div data-w-id="8edfbcd1-69dd-658a-7784-9f7314c63291" class="footer-accordion-trigger"><div class="footer-links-title">About</div><div class="footer-accordion-icon"></div></div><div class="footer-accordion-content"><a href="about.html" class="footer-link-2022">About</a><a href="https://jobs.optimism.io/jobs" target="_blank" class="footer-link-2022">Careers</a><a href="https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/brand-kit" target="_blank" class="footer-link-2022">Brand assets</a><a href="https://dune.com/optimismfnd/Optimism-Overview" target="_blank" class="footer-link-2022">On-chain data</a><a href="legal-terms-and-disclosures.html" class="footer-link-2022">Legal Terms &amp; Disclosures</a><a href="community-notice.html" target="_blank" class="footer-link-2022">Community Notice</a><div class="accordion-vertical-spacer"></div></div><div class="footer-line-mobile"></div></div></div><div class="footer-bottom-flex"><div class="footer-social-links-container"><a href="https://twitter.com/optimismFND" target="_blank" class="footer-social-link-2022 twitter w-inline-block"><div class="twitter-icon-embed w-embed"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 52 52" fill="none">
